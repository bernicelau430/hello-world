# hello-world
Practice :)

Hello! My name is Bernice and I'm an incoming junior in high school. I'm passionate about management, robotics, and tech! In my free time, I attend virtual webinars and workshops to improve my technical skills and gain insight from professionals in the tech or business industries. I also have a toy poodle (he'll be 2 years old in October!)
